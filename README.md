Real World Data Structures and Algorithms in Go, as well as HackerRank challenges I solved
## Tips
1. Most Go lookup operations that use built-in types have constant time (O(1)). Hence, built-in types are faster than custom types and should be used where possible, unless you want full control.
2. Array operations are faster than map operations, but maps are more versatile.
3. For smaller datasets, it doesn't really matter the algorithm you choose.
