# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS IN GO
## Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step unambiguous instruction to solve 
a give problem.
### Analysis of Algorithms
Algorithmic analysis helps to determine which algorithm is efficient 
in terms of time and space consumed.
The goal of analysis is to determine the amount of time and space resources 
required to execute it. 
### Running time analysis
It is the process of determining how processing time increases as the
size of the problem input size increase.
